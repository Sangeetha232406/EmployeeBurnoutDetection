# EmployeeBurnoutDetection
Employee burnout, all too common in today's workspace as things move at a thousand miles an hour within high-paced environments with the associated mental exhaustion and churn-rates. But this burnout not only impacts employee health, it has a chain reaction down the drain of productivity turnover and systemic problems for the organization over time. This paper presents a deep learning predictive model for predicting the employee burn rate, which is a key metric which gets burnt off with respect to burnout level. Employing preprocessing techniques, feature engineering and supervised regression models we take advantage of a well-selected dataset with features like mental exhaustion scores, the job have done day and resource usages In the approach, we use deep neural network architecture which works with multiple hidden layers, batch normalization as well as dropout regularization technique are used to prevent overfitting and early stopping. From our training and cross-validation on several pieces the dataset we reach remarkable figures as compared to baseline state-of-the-art machine learning techniques such as Random Forest Regression in important metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and the RÂ² Score We show that AI-powered tools for burnout prediction can do the future HR intervention faster by creating healthier workspaces and guiding in workforce planning strategy. It has the promise to be flexible and scalable to diverse organizational environments that underpins the development of next-generation employee support systems.
